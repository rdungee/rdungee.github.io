Hi there, my name is Ryan Dungee and I grew up in Las Vegas.
I did my undergrad (BA) and a master's degree (MSc) in Physics at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.
After that I moved to Honolulu where I started in the Astronomy PhD program at the Institue for Astronomy, there I earned a second MSc and my PhD both in Astronomy.
I currently live in Toronto, where I am a Dunlap Fellow at the Dunlap Institute for Astronomy & Astrophysics.
Outside of my work in astronomy I like to spend my downtime running, working on my photography (particularly of birds), and reading (mostly fantasy and sci-fi).
